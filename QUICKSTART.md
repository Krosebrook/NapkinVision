# ⚡ Quickstart

Get the environment running in under 60 seconds.

## 1. Environment
Ensure you have a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Safari). No local compiler is required as the app uses native ESM.

## 2. Local Development
```bash
# Serve the root directory
npx serve .
```

## 3. Configuration
The app expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be injected. In a production environment like Vercel, add this to the Environment Variables settings.

## 4. Golden Path
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Drag a **floor plan** image into the upload area.
3. Wait for the "Structuring layout" progress.
4. Use **Inspect** (Eye icon) to check the generated DOM elements.
5. Click **Download .html** to keep your artifact.
